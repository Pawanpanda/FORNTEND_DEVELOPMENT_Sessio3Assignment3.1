<div class="div1">Web</div>
<div class="div2">div2 - Notice that the div2 element is after div1, in the HTML code. However, since div1 is floated to the left, this happens: 
the text in div2 is floated around div1, and div2 surrounds the whole thing.</div>

Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or just 'web apps')
 electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
